<center><b>Isolating the Effects of Pollution Externalities from Natural Resource Extraction on Local Agricultural Output in Africa
</b></center>





***Abstract***:

This paper explores the extent to which pollution externalities and market-based effects from industrial mining affect local agricultural output in Sub-Saharan Africa. I combine mine geolocations, topographical data and satellite-based measures of pollution, yields and weather, to identify areas around mines that are disproportionately exposed to pollution but not market-specific effects. Leveraging the staggered openings of mines across Sub-Saharan Africa, I find that air and water pollution externalities from mines account for almost 50% of the overall reduction in yields caused by industrial mining. Finally, I use both standard heterogeneity analysis as well as machine learning methods to document that pollution externalities are larger for mines in countries with poor governance and regulatory environments, as well as for mines located in areas with low initial levels of pollution

<center><b>The Economic Potential for Area-Yield Crop Insurance: An Application to Maize in Ghana</b> with Ashish Shenoy (conditionally accepted at The Journal of Agricultural Economics)</center>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

Rainfall insurance can enable farm households to manage production risk, but demand remains low at market prices. Area–yield crop insurance, which links payouts to average yield in a geographic zone, attempts to increase demand by more accurately targeting production shortfalls. However, shifting from an exogenous weather-based to an endogenous yield-based insurance index introduces concerns of asymmetric information, which can constrain supply from providers. These features are inversely related: larger insurance zones prohibit index manipulation, but average yield is less informative about any individual plot. We quantify this tradeoff for maize in Ghana using a spatial yield model calibrated to match observed production. Insurers must be willing to demarcate zones of no more than 5,000 farmers for area–yield insurance to outperform weather insurance. The framework presented in this paper allows assessment of market viability for new crop insurance products

<center><b>Causal Inference with Predicted Outcomes: A satellite-based impact assessment of ‘Direct Seed Marketing’ in Ethiopia</b> with Johanne Pelletier, Solomon Alemu, Manex Bule Yonis, Travis J. Lybbert and Matthieu Stigler (submitted to the Journal of Development Economics)</center>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

Recent advances in earth observation and machine learning have opened new frontiers in impact evaluation that appear well-suited for agricultural settings. We apply these promising methods in the context of Ethiopia’s Direct Seed Marketing (DSM) program, which rolled out after 2011 and aims to enhance farmer access to improved seed varieties. Our satellite-based impact assessment focuses on maize productivity as a summary outcome. Satellite-based yield predictions enable a high-resolution, landscape-level analysis of DSM impacts using a difference-in-difference identification strategy, but yield prediction errors introduce new sources of potential bias in subsequent causal inference. We test for this prediction error bias and compare our DSM impact estimates to those that use farmer-reported and crop cut yield measures. We find evidence of small positive but insignificant effects of the DSM on maize yield, explore how errors in predicted yields introduce bias in causal estimation, and discuss implications for the selection of prediction models.
